# Operators and Expressions

This section discusses operators and expressions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Operators

Operators are special symbols which produce some result given 1, 2, or 3
values.  They are usually similar to the operators you would see on a four
function calculator, for example `+ - * /` are all operators in C, and they
behave similar to how you might expect.

### Addition (`+`)

This is an example of a addition of two integers:

```snippet
{"code": "snippets/addition.c"}
```

Pretty straightforward right?  Ok, let's look at one more example

```snippet
{"code": "snippets/overflow_addition.c"}
```

Huh...  That's weird.

### Overflow

You should remember from the last section that short integers typically can't
hold values greater than `32,767`.  Here we tried to add two short integers to
a value larger than the maximum.  C does not cause any errors in this case, it
merely plays along, and adds them as it would normally.  Except in this case,
there is a carry at the end that the variable simply as no space for, and it
discards it.  This is called overflow.  You should notice then that the result
isn't random.  The result is what happens when you add the numbers normally,
except that past 32,767 it loops around to `-32,768`

```snippet
{"code": "snippets/overflow_addition_exact.c"}
```

```snippet
{"code": "snippets/overflow_addition_exact_max.c"}
```

This means we can check if overflow occurred by checking that the sign of the
result is the same as the sign of both inputs (if they are the same, otherwise
overflow wouldn't occur)

### Multiplication (`*`)

This is an example of a multiplication of two integers:

```snippet
{"code": "snippets/multiplication.c"}
```
